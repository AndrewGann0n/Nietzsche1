        This is one of Nietzche's more famous works <BR>
        He was named after King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia. <BR>
        Nietzsche went to school in Naumborg, where academic records show he excelled in Christian Theology. <br>
        This is ironic considering he would later denounce Christianity and believe Christians to be weak. <br>
        Nietzsche got into the prestigious Schulpforta, He wrote about Poets and became intrigued by non-German writers. <br>
