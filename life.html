    <p class="bio">
    Friedrich Nietzsche was born on October 15th, 1944 in the town of Rocken. <BR>
    He was named after King Friedrich Wilhelm IV of Prussia. <BR>
    Nietzsche went to school in Naumborg, where academic records show he excelled in Christian Theology. <br>
    This is ironic considering he would later denounce Christianity and believe Christians to be weak. <br>
    Nietzsche got into the prestigious Schulpforta, He wrote about Poets and became intrigued by non-German writers. <br>

        Nietzsche got a job as a professor of classics at the age of 24. <BR>
        This is quite young and his thesis was "Contribution toward the Study and the Critique of the Sources of Diogenes Laertius" <BR>
        Before moving to Basel, Nietzsche renounced his Prussian citizenship: for the rest of his life he remained officially stateless. <br>
        Nietzsche served in the Prussian forces during the Franco-Prussian War (1870â€“1871) as a medical orderly. <br>
        His experiences in the military helped form many of his rebellious intellectual tendencies. <br>
        He saw Otto Von Bismarck establish the German Republic as an outsider and Nietzsche doubted his intentions. <BR>

        Nietzsche fell victim to serious health problems at different points <BR>
        of his life. Scholars note he had dysentry, diphtheria, eye sight problems, possibly syphillis, and a bunch of significant mental health issues. <BR>
        This derailed his ability to function on a day to day basis and work as an intellectual. <br>
        This is ironic considering he would later denounce Christianity and believe Christians to be weak. <br>
        Nietzsche got into the prestigious Schulpforta, He wrote about Poets and became intrigued by non-German writers. <br>
